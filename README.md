# Bonobo Substitution

![](img/Picture.png)

This program aims to censor the word _bolsonaro_ in browser normal browsing usage. It works by searching and replacing every instance of the word ~that should not be written or read loudly~ for a similar and friendly one. 
I hope it serves you well. In case it doesn't work, I recommend [this](eyebleach.me).

In sometime at @lekonjak there will be a chrome version of the same app, that wouldn't be in the official chrome store because we cannot afford the [five](https://0x0.st/s-x) dollar fee.
